LIFX Movie experience

Match your LIFX bulbs to the average colour of your screen. 

- This version uses the much faster LAN protocol.
- Splits the screen into left and right segments and allows you to control two sets of bulbs independently. 
- Crops the screen and not take the black portion into account when calculating average colour. 
- Better black colour handling.
